# HealthInsurance_Cost-Predition

This is a Health Insurance Cost Prediction Machine learning Model which predicts the Insurance cost for a particular person on the basis of nummber of parameters such 
as the Age of the person,Sex of the person, the number of children the person has, in which does the person stay etc.

In this model we have used the Random Forest Regression model in order to predict the prices of the Insurance.

In order to deploy the model I have saved the machine learning model from google colaboratory to a .SAV file using the PICKLE library in python and then used the 
STREAMLIT Library from python to create the Graphical User Interface(GUI). The code for the same was written in the SPYDER IDE from the Anaconda Navigator.
